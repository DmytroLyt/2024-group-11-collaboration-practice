all_permutations Function
Behavior Description:

The all_permutations function generates all permutations of a given list of elements using a recursive approach. It employs a yield statement to produce permutations incrementally, making it memory-efficient for large input lists.

Parameter Description:

elements: A list of elements for which permutations are to be generated.
Return Value Description:
The function utilizes the yield statement to produce permutations incrementally.
Each permutation is generated as a list.

Assumptions:

The function assumes that the input (elements) is a list.
It handles empty input lists and returns an empty list as the result.
The function is designed to work for any iterable, not just strings or lists.

perm Function
Behavior Description:

The perm function generates all permutations of a given list of elements using a recursive approach. It prints each permutation as it is generated.

Parameter Description:

start: The list for which permutations are to be generated.
end: (Optional) A list that accumulates the current permutation during the recursive calls.
Return Value Description:
The function does not explicitly return a value. It prints each permutation as a side effect.

Assumptions:
The function assumes that the input (start) is a list.
It handles empty input lists and prints an empty list as the result.

permutation Function
Behavior Description:
The permutation function generates all permutations of a given list of elements using a recursive approach. It returns a list containing all the permutations.

Parameter Description:
lst: A list of elements for which permutations are to be generated.
Return Value Description:
The function returns a list containing all permutations.
Each permutation is represented as a list.

Assumptions:
The function assumes that the input (lst) is a list.
It handles empty input lists and returns an empty list as the result.
